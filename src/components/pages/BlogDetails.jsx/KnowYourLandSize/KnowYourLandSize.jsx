                                                    Because "Size" is one of the main basis of negotiation when it comes to land, you can be cheated easily without knowing if you don't understand how it works.
                                                    <br />
                                                    Let's simplify the land size matter for you. It might become one of your greatest assets in negotiating, designing and in choosing the best property deals whether now or in your future transactions.

                                                    A plot of land is just a marked out piece of land for the purpose of building, farming, title transfer or other land uses. It can be of any size. A very large expanse of land that is cut out for an estate construction can be referred to as plot, yet, the tiny tiny division of the land within the large estate expanse are also called plots.

                                                    Sometimes approximated as 18m√ó36m >> 648sqm

                                                    Sometimes approximated as >> 15mx30m >> 450sqm

                                                    Typically, a 450sqm of land will take 2 units of standard 3 bedroom duplexes - built as semi detached, with at least 3 car parking lots for each of the 2 apartments.
                                                    <br />
                                                    It's important to note that the actual size and the approximate size are not the same. So you have to be clear on the exact sizes they're selling to you.
                                                    <br />
                                                    This means that whenever you want to buy, you will need to specifically ask for the square meters(sqm), "meters by meters" or "feet by feet" of the parcel.
                                                    <br />

                                                    Generally, the standard plot according to the land division in Nigeria is regarded as either 60ft√ó120ft OR 50ftx100ft
                                                    <br />
                                                    Now, the specific "standard" plot size used across different locations varies from location to location based on different reasons.
                                                    <br />
                                                    In Ikoyi of Lagos state(not the Ikoyi of Osun and Igbokodaü§ì), around 2400sqm is used as a standard plot because it's a low-density area.
                                                    <br />
                                                    In Lekki, around 900 to 1300sqm is used as a plot, because it's a mid-density area.
                                                    <br />
                                                    Most estate in Ibeju-lekki use around 450sqm which is 15mx30m
                                                    <br />

                                                    The standard units of land devoid of ambiguity or unnecessary approximations are ACRE and HECTARE
                                                    <br />
                                                    An acre of land is a standard unit common in bulk land trading. It is 4000sqm.
                                                    <br />
                                                    This 4000sqm is approximately equivalent to 6 standard plots of 60ft√ó120ft.
                                                    That is, 6√ó60ft√ó120ft== 6x18.3mx36.6m == 4,018.68sqm
                                                    <br />

                                                    While HECTARE is the standard metric unit used by government land/property agencies and land professionals. It is 10,000sqm or 2.5Acres.
                                                    <br />
                                                    This is approximately equivalent to a 15 standard plot of 60ftx120ft.
                                                    That is, 15x60ftx120ft == 15x18.3mx36.6m == 10,046.7sqm
                                                    <br />
                                                    That's all.

It's because we do not want to eat your right nor allow you to eat our right. Fair enough!
