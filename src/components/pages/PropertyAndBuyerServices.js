            <h2><b>Before you buy your next property, do you know how you won't fall into scam?</b></h2><br /><br />
            <h4>Are you an individual home buyer or land investor ready to buy a home or land for yourself?</h4><br />
            <h4>Are you a property developer or an organisation ready to buy bulk buildings or land expanse?</h4><br />
            <ul className="list-style-two">
              <li>You want to buy property either from an estate developer, from an individual or from the Omo-Onile but you haven't realised that there are  long tasks ahead of you.</li>
              <li>You've probably seen buildings being demolished, land owners getting evicted and property buyers getting duped here and there…</li>
              <p>Here's the truth. </p>
              <p>Perhaps you have concluded that it's because the victims didn't consult a lawyer and/or a surveyor?</p>
              <p>Anyone can fall victim of these losses irrespective of whether you are an individual, developer, organisation, professional or even realtor buying for your clients.</p>
              <p>The losses are due to issues like:
                Survey manipulation, C of O manipulation, fake Allocation, encumbered property, internal and external disputes,  committed acquisition, property encroaching road, wrong uses, incomplete documentation, fake "title under processing", price extortion, building with defective structure, property that is susceptible to flooding, untruthful professionals, dubious agents, dubious developers, greedy Omo-Onile, property with multiple owners, not perfecting title on time, not taking immediate possession, etc
              </p>
            </ul><br />
            <p><b>Now you're even worried about </b></p>
            <ul className="list-style-two">
              <li>Getting the right agent that won't extort you…</li>
              <li>Ensuring you're not scammed is a hard task…</li>
              <li>Buying from the right developer or individual that will guarantee your investments...</li>
              <li>Knowing how you'll get a competent and truthful professional that will assure you of buying right…</li>
              <li>Do you even know the kind of lawyers to consult for your property or do you think any lawyer can give you the right landed property search and advice?</li>
              <li>Do you know that it's not every "surveyor" that knows about correlating the site with its documents?</li>
              <li>Do you know that aside from getting the right lawyer and the right surveyor, there are other professionals that must also check before you pay?</li>
              <li>How about the stress of going for many inspections, the worries of getting a trusted and ethical professional to represent you without their personal greed, the headache of the humongous documentation processes, the panic of transferring money to the wrong account especially now that property impersonation is on the rise.</li>
